1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
   The five objects created in the main are 3 dogs named Fido, Fido, and Alfie. Another object is the arraylist for the dogs and the last 
   object is the new Comparator created in collections sort. 

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
   Yes I can spot the Comparator constructor call inside the Collections.sort call. The class definition for the Comparator class is inside the brackets for the collections.sort method which defines the overridden method compare.
